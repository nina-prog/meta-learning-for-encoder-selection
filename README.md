## Setting up the environment and run the code ▶️

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/data-science-lab-2023/group-5-targaryen/phase-2.git
   ```


2. Navigate to the project root directory by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   cd phase-2
   ```

3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment and activate it. For example, using the built-in `venv` module in Python:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv-phase-2
   source venv-phase-2/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Place the data in the phase-2/data/raw folder. Ensure that the data is in the appropriate format and structure 
required by the pipeline.

6. Run the pipeline with the following command:

   ```
   python3 main.py --config "configs/config.yaml"
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the  pipeline on the data and obtain the desired 
results. You can also monitor the pipeline's progress through the logs printed in the terminal. If any errors or issues 
occur, the logs will provide valuable information for troubleshooting.
